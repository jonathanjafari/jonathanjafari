## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
- Physician (DO) pivoting to **Clinical/Health Informatics**
- 6+ years as a clinical reviewer / physician advisor (medico-legal case reviews, medical necessity, inpatient reimbursement appeals)
- **Building practical machine-learning tools** that make **electronic health records faster** and **decisions clearer**

## üè• Professional Interests
- Clinical decision support & electronic health record optimization  
- Healthcare data management & analytics  
- Clinical terminology and interoperability standards

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools
- **Data/ML:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, SQL (databases)  
- **Apps/Cloud:** Streamlit, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, *Docker (learning)*  
- **Healthcare:** electronic health record workflows, chart review, documentation quality  
- **Also:** clear READMEs, lightweight UIs, stakeholder-friendly explanations

## ‚≠ê Featured Projects
| Project | What it is | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| **Medical Codex Pipeline** ‚Äî maps and searches standard clinical code sets (diagnoses, procedures, labs, medications, provider IDs). **Repo:** [medical-codex-pipeline](https://github.com/jonathanjafari/medical-codex-pipeline) | Standardizes vocabularies to clean CSVs with validation + logging | `Python` `pandas` `regex` |
| **Virtual Machine Lifecycle on Google Cloud & Oracle Cloud** ‚Äî tutorial with short demo videos. **Repo:** [gcp_oci_vm_start](https://github.com/jonathanjafari/gcp_oci_vm_start) | Create ‚Üí start ‚Üí stop ‚Üí terminate ‚Üí cleanup; pitfalls & checklists | `Cloud` `Google Cloud` `Oracle Cloud` |

*Planned (in progress):* **Sepsis Risk Predictor** (Streamlit, explainable scoring) ‚Ä¢ **Denial Prediction** (explainable models for payer/appeals strategy). Repos coming soon.

## üå± Currently Learning
**Open-Source Cloud Computing (Cloud Foundations)**  
- Linux and the command line, server setup/administration, Git/GitHub, security best practices, and the Domain Name System  
- Outcome: stand up and harden a Linux server, containerize a web app, manage domains and secure connections, and deploy to a cloud virtual machine

**Data Science for Healthcare (Python & R)**  
- Statistics and analytics tooling in Python and R; overview of healthcare-oriented machine learning  
- Final project: choose a healthcare dataset; build a cleaning pipeline, exploratory visuals, and a simple analysis/model with a short write-up
